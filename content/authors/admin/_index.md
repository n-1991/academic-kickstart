In Autumn 2021, I will be starting as a Swiss National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at University of Oslo.

I graduated with a PhD in Economics from The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva. My research interests include studying decision making under uncertainty, modeled using stochastic processes, with a focus on environmental economics and firm dynamics. In my free time I enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy.
