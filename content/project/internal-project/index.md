The cancellation of conferences and workshops has left several young scholars without an opportunity to present their research. The aim of this workshop is to provide PhD candidates (especially those on the job market) with feedback and support.
- **Date** 4 - 5 June 2020   

All timings are Central European Time (CET). Presentations will be 30 minutes, followed by a 10 minute discussion and 10 minutes for general Q&A.
