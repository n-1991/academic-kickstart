abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance is one of the biggest global public health threats today. Although misuse of antibiotics is an important driver, it is a complex problem that is interlinked with the wider environment, especially with agriculture. In this paper I show, within the context of England, that intensive livestock farming plays a significant role in driving antimicrobial resistance in humans. I then show that poverty is a crucial factor influencing this relation, with higher poverty magnifying the effect intensive farming has on resistance. Finally I document agricultural pollution and contamination via ready to eat meals, as potential mechanisms underlying the transmission from intensive farms to humans.
