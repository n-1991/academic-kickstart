abstract: Do religions codify ecological principles? This paper explores empirically and theoretically the role religious beliefs play in shaping environmental interactions. I study African Traditional Religions which place forests within a sacred sphere. Relying on the unique case of Benin where adherence is freely reported, I use an instrumental variable strategy and estimate a robust and positive effect of adherence to traditional religions on the five year average annual change in forest cover. An investigation of the causal mechanisms suggests a presence of a set of attitudes within adherents that reflect environmental stewardship and sustainability. I then study the persistence of belonging to the ancient Kingdom of Dahomey, birthplace of Vodun, one of the largest traditional religions in Benin. Using the original boundaries as a spatial discontinuity, I find positive evidence of the impact of historically belonging to the Kingdom on contemporary forest change. Motivated by these findings, I build a model in which the interactions of a multitude of agents with heterogeneous religious adherence affect continuously the spatial density of the aggregate forest cover. The model shows how the potential scarcity of natural resources can characterize both individual and aggregate decisions, and the distribution of religious beliefs among the population can be a key driver of forest conservation.

# summary: We study the stochastic dynamics of a renewable resource harvested by a monopolist where harvesting affects the resourceâ€™s potential to regenerate, resulting in sequential regime shifts.
