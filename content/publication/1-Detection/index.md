abstract: Decisions under ecological uncertainty are a crucial part of resource management as many ecological systems can  undergo large and sudden regime shifts in their structure, frequently triggered by the actions of the resource harvester. We study the stochastic dynamics of a renewable resource harvested by a monopolist facing a downward sloping demand curve. We introduce a framework where harvesting sequentially affects the resource's potential to regenerate, resulting in an endogenous ecological regime shift. The firm encounters two sources of uncertainty in the resources dynamics, the natural variability and the timing of this regime shift. In a multi-regime setting, the firm's objective is to find the profit-maximizing extraction policy while simultaneously detecting in the quickest time possible the change in regime. Encapsulating the idea of environmental surveillance, the use of quickest detection method allows us to easily translate our framework to real-time detection. Solving analytically, we study how the extraction policy of the firm changes pre and post regime change. We find that at higher stock levels, the detection of a negative regime shift induces an aggressive extraction due to an elastic market demand allowing the monopolist to charge higher markups. At lower stocks, precautionary behaviour can result due to increasing resource rent. Additionally, we find that larger is the magnitude of the regime shift the faster a firm is likely to detect it resulting in the monopolist intensifying its aggressive and precautionary extraction efforts for all levels of stock. Finally, we study the probability of extinction and show the emergence of catastrophe risk which can be both reversible and irreversible.
